# portfolio
## overview

This is a simple, clean website for showcasing no more than 3 projects. Any more, and I feel that the portfolio gets too crowded. Any fewer doesn't represent enough.

My philosopy with this project was to create something clean, timeless, and easy to interact with as the user and as any future modifier of the code.

## Ideas to Improve
- Complete the WCAG Accessibility checklist
- Add favicon
- Play with link preview images
- Make project and code link buttons all one solid border color, more thin, and close to the width of the container
